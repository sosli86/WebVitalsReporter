This project consists of a common code base along with specific implemen-
tations for WordPress and Shopify.

The common code will consist of HTML templates along with javascript code as
the business end. Javascript was selected because WIX does not support PHP,
and while it and all other platforms mentioned for compatibility needs
(WordPress, Shopify, and Webflow) support JS.

The WordPress version will require a PHP interface. The Shopify version will
use a JavaScript interface.

business.js
